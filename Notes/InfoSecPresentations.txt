Presentation 1
HEAP
	-high-efficiency and privacy-preserving range query framework in participatory sensing
	-Focuses on privacy of users, energy efficiency of mobile devices
	-ID and Data servers are separate
Modular verification items
	-Data integrity verification
	-This field consumes more energy
	-Doesn't know requester; rarely considers things malicious
Problem Formulation
	-Dynamic game
Pure Strategy
	-When DS manipulates, users should attach
	-When users attach, DS shouldn't manipulate
	-When DS doesn't manipulate, users shouldn't attach
	-When users don't attach, DS should manipulate
Mixed Strategy
	-User determines own probability to attach a field
Conclusions
	-Proposed scheme assumes every DS is malicious

Presentation 2 - Hadoop Security
Core Hadoop Architecture
	-4 parts
HDFS Components
	-Big data storage layer for Apache Hadoop
Master/Slave Architecture
	-Master: NameNode
	-Slaves: DataNode - read/write
Block
	-User data stored in files which are separated into blocks
	-Default size: 64MB
MapReduce
	-Two tasks: Map Task and Reduce Task
Security Implementation Issues
	-Volume - security will reduce the efficiency
	-Variety
	-Velocity
Basic Authentication
	-Only uses a login for security
Security in Motion
	-Communication of blocks happens b/t client and server
	-Needs to be encrypted to avoid spoofing
DOS Attack
	-Can be performed on Hadoop systems
Impersonation Attack
	-Spoofing essentially
Loss of Control
	-Can't track who is accessing data
Privacy Concerns
Comparison of Proposed/Current System
	-SSL/TLS Encryption is currently used; slower thann DES and AES
	-Certificates are used in current scheme
Encryption
	-Honey encryption: produces a ciphertext that when incorrectly decrypted by attack gives a plausible result

Presentation 3 - Access Control in Cloud
Benefits
Issues (Main three)
	-Security
	-Performance
	-Availability
Threats
	-Data breach
	-Access Control
	-Permanent Data Loss
	-Compromised Credentials
	-DoS
	-Malicious Insiders
	-Encryption Algorithm cracks
	-Account hijacking
	-Shared technologies
Proposed Idea - Two factor Authentication Method
Tokens
	-Give one time password for access
Three-Factor Authentication
